👋 Hi, I’m @Crypto-Rose

<h3>I’m interested in Programming, Design, ilustration; in short 👀, everything that I can express my thoughts on. 🌱</h3>  <br/><br/>
By day ☀, I am a freelance design student 🌌, I create content such as beautiful vectors, modified images, gifs (a bit basic but they are on the right track)✨.

By night 🌙, I'm a great and wonderful programmer ❤, I'm starting from scratch so if you don't see much around here, I hope you can excuse me and wait patiently while I build my life in the Geek world again 🛠.
I like to develop Frontend 🎪, little things in the Javascript world, I'm not lying, I also make small contributions in Backend but not much, my favorites are any language that gives me more knowledge 🏆


📫 Welcome!
